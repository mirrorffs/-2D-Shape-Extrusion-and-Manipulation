#2D-Shape-Extrusion-and-Manipulation
The goal of this assignment is to create a Babylon.js application that allows the user to draw arbitrary 2D shapes on the ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and then manipulate those objects by moving the object and editing their vertices using buttons for mode selection.

Installation:
-> npm install

Run:
-> npm run dev

About:
-> This project is built on Babylon.js using Vite as a local development server. 

Functionalities: 
-> Draw 2D shapes on the 3D ground plane using mouse interactions such as left click to add points and right click to complete the shape.
-> Perform extrusion on the 2D shapes created on the ground plane.
-> Move the extruded objects on the ground plane using mouse interactions
-> Visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode (draw, move, or edit vertices).
